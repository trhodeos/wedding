          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p>The short version of the story is we were best friends who decided to get married. The long version is a little bit more interesting. It all started when Melissa, Shradha and I needed a new roommate. Shradha and Tyler knew each other from days together in UT Natural Science Council, and he was brave enough to say he was willing to live with 3 girls. Tyler moved in during the summer when Shradha and Melissa were living in Houston, so we got to know each other really well. We bonded over our love for tex mex, good tv shows, and the search for a dog for Tyler to adopt (which we were super successful with because Scout is the best dog ever). I joked that he was basically my boyfriend because we did everything together. Little did I know 6 months later we would be dating, and 2 years later we would be engaged and living in San Francisco!</p>

          <h2>How He Proposed</h2>
          <p>Tyler proposed on February 22, 2014 in Austin and it was a complete surprise. I was under the impression that we were going to a boat party on Town Lake to celebrate our friend, Sid. How this wasn’t suspicious to me, I have no idea! We spent the day like any other day: doing chores around the house and grabbing a late lunch at South Congress Cafe. As we were heading to the dock, Tyler started to stall and said we needed to grab coffee because he was tired. Apparently, our friends weren’t done decorating the boat for our arrival and told him to wait. I was super worried that we would miss the boat, but still wasn’t catching on to the ploy. Once we make our way down to the dock, Tyler tells me that we have to take a practice run on the boat before the party gets there. The boat was decorated with white streamers and had two glasses of champagne...still I don’t suspect a thing other than they had very questionable decorations for a boat party for a guy! We make our way out to the middle of the lake where it all clicks as he stops the boat and pulls the ring out. Of course I said YES! We went back around and picked up some of our closest friends and called our family. The surprises didn’t stop there because little did I know that both of our families were back at the house to surprise us with an engagement party. It was the absolute best.</p>

            <img class="party image" src="img/party/melissa.jpg">
            <h3>Melissa Timmons</h3>
            <b>The College Roommate</b>
            <p class="party-blurb">It all started Sophomore year of high school when I’m pretty sure Paige and I challenged her to a game of 007 Nightfire on Play Station. We quickly became close and decided we would room together as freshman at UT. Little did I know that would start a 4 year stint as a married couple (sorry, Tyler!). We’ve been through it all and grown so much together throughout college.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="party-section">
            <img class="party image" src="img/party/paige.jpg">
            <h3>Paige Fults</h3>
            <b>The Childhood Friend</b>
            <p class="party-blurb">Not many people can say they’ve seen me in a diaper...luckily. Paige and I have exceeded all boundaries when it comes to our friendship. We were Brownies together and vampires together. We remained best friends in a pre-cell phone and pre-email world when I moved to Saudi, and we are closer than ever despite living on separate sides of the country. It’s pretty awesome.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="party-section">
            <img class="party image" src="img/party/jenn.jpg">
            <h3>Jennifer Bell</h3>
            <b>The Post-College BFF</b>
            <p class="party-blurb">It’s safe to say that Jenn has been there to support me through all the life changes of the last 2 years. Not many people can say that their friendship started around a night dedicated to watching notoriously bad movies, but we did it! She has been there from the early months of my relationship with Tyler, to the engagement, and through our move to California. She is also the best listener in the world.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="party-section">
            <img class="party image" src="img/party/ellen.jpg">
            <h3>Ellen Pitts</h3>
            <b>The Aggie</b>
            <p class="party-blurb">Because every Longhorn needs that one Aggie friend! We were close in high school but I would have never guessed we would remain as close as we did throughout college. I can always be certain that even though Ellen and I have grown separately, we seem to always resume right where we left off. Since I followed her to the Pacific coast, I am only sure that our friendship will remain this way for years to come.</p>

            <h3>Shradha Thakur</h3>
            <b>The Introducer</b>
            <p class="party-blurb">In high school the whole school did a “friendship test” to identify who within your grade you were compatible with - all in the name of charity of course. Shradha turned out to be my number one pick. We went about our high school careers never really interacting until the end of freshman year of UT. Melissa and I were looking for more roommates and Shradha just so happened to need some as well (and a 414 shoutout to Brenna)! I guess the compatibility test was correct because we ended up living together for 4 years. And one final note, I’m going to give Shradha the credit she has always wanted: she is responsible for introducing Tyler and I.</p>

            <h3>Jeff Rhodes</h3>
            <b>The Brother</b>
            <p class="party-blurb">Jeff and I go way back. Even though he once hit me with a ping pong paddle so hard that it broke (I won the match :) ), Jeff has always been an awesome role model for me. Some might even say that is why we ended up being so similar. Even though we live on opposite sides of the country, every time we see each other it’s like we never missed a beat.</p>

            <b>The Drummer</b>
            <p class="party-blurb">I still remember meeting Alec while waiting our percussion lessons during the summer before 8th grade. Fast forward 10 (!?) years. We have been through it all: drumline, proms, graduations, and, most importantly, monster truck rallies. Give it a couple more months, and I’ll be able to add a wedding to that list!</p>

            <h3>Simon Dollo</h3>
            <b>The Canadian</b>
            <p class="party-blurb">In true Canadian fashion, the first word Simon ever spoke to me was “Sorry”. Sorry for what, you may ask. I honestly don’t remember. He was probably sorry for introducing me to the movie “The Room.” Or maybe it was for almost killing us in his brake-less car. All jokes aside, Simon has been a fantastic friend ever since the first (but definitely not last) "sorry," and I’m so glad he’s going to be a part of our special day.</p>

            <h3>Will Campbell</h3>
            <b>The Soups</b>
            <p class="party-blurb">Will “Lil’ Soups” Campbell was one of the HomeAway-ers that I met. With similar interests (that definitely no one else had), such as frisbee and beer, we were destined to be best buds. And best buds we became. Over the next two years, we watched some of the crappiest movies ever made, endured Simon’s terrible, terrible puns, and worked really hard at avoiding work.</p>

            <h3>Richard Veras</h3>
            <b>The Influencer</b>
            <p class="party-blurb">It’s true: Richard and I met in high school computer science club. We were cool kids back then, much like we are now. When I was checking out colleges, I hadn’t even considered going to UT until Richard showed me around. He even got me into his research group (cool kids, remember?). Despite becoming vegetarian “for the fun of it”, Richard was my best friend throughout college, and I can’t even begin to count the number of adventures we had.</p>

          <h3>How To Get There</h3>
          <p>Our wedding will take place at the Hills of Lakeway Country Club.</p>
          <p>Because this is in a gated area, map programs will give you wrong directions. Once you get to the intersection of Lohman's Crossing and Wingreen Loop, follow these instructions:
          <ul>
            <li>Turn on to Wingreen Loop.</li>
            <li>Proceed into the guard-gated entrance of The Hills and check in with security.</li> 
            <li>After checking in with Security, proceed through the gate and drive to the 2nd Stop Sign, turn right onto The Hills Drive.</li>
            <li>Proceed along The Hills Drive until coming to a Stop Sign at Clubs Estate Parkway and turn left.</li>
            <li>Go approximately 1 mile until you reach The Hills Country Club Clubhouse on the left.</li>
          </ul>
          For more detailed instructions, read <a href="img/directions.pdf">this</a>.

          <p>As a couple of displaced Texans, we have come to miss a few great Texas/Austin "traditions". For those of y'all coming in from out of town, we have a few suggestions:
          <ul>
            <li>BBQ - Nothing is better than Texas BBQ. We suggest: Schmidt Family BBQ, La Barbecue, Franklin (well worth the 4 hour wait), Stiles and Switch.</li>
            <li>Tex Mex - The greasier, the better. We suggest: Trudy's, Santa Ritas, Santa Catarina.</li>
            <li>Breakfast Tacos - Never had them before? Trust us. We suggest: Taco Deli, Torchy's.</li>
            <li>Visit UT's campus (Hook 'em)</li>
            <li>Visit the Texas State Capitol Building</li>
            <li>Like parks? Check out Zilker park near downtown</li>
            <li>Talk a walk around South Congress street (SoCo, if you will), near Monroe St. Hopdoddy and Homeslice are our favorite restaraunts around there.</li>
